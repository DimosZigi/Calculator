# Calculator
A calculator made in Python with the use of Tkinter. I made it while learning how to use tkinter to test my mastery 

on the package.


What the prject does is creating a GUI with buttons. Each button coresponds to a number or an operational symbol;

(+) --> addition

(-) --> subtraction

(*) --> multiplication

(/) --> division

(=) --> equal sign

(C) --> clear button

# The project
You can learn a lot of things while creating something as simple as an easy GUI calculator. You may use

my project to study tkinter or just learn how to make it.

# Getting Started
The process is simple enough. It can be made by anyone who has some understanding in Python and Tkinter.

First we need to access tkinter to create the GUI. Then we create the calculator window as seen below.

Our window is a tkinter object and it is what we need to define first before we write the code. We can 

also define a title for the window and an icon (even though it is not used here).

Then we should use .mainloop to avoid the window closing immediately.



We continue by defining the entry; where all the math will take place, the buttons of the numbers.

The opertions the equal sign (=) and the clear button (C).

After that, we define the functions for the buttons at the beginning of the code as seen below.

Fill the functions, and then we must grid the elemntes on the window.

The result should look something like the first image. If you want you may add more buttons like sqrts,

powers, etc. You may change the colors and other grafical features and play with the code however you want.

If you just want to download and study the code you can download the raw file.
